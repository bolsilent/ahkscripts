# ahkscripts

Hello, and Welcome to my (semi) small collection of AutoHotKey scripts for the game oldschool Runescape


In the 1:1 Folder you will find scripts that prior to the ban on AHK, were completely legitmate, as well as some that... were not.

In the Automated scripts folder you will find variations of cordinate autoclickers, and a few other other projects that were made while learning the very basics of AHK.

In the Examples folder, you will find various examples both related to Osrs and just showing how to use random things such as incrementing loops, ImageSearching, Playing Mp3 sounds, time between clicks,
 and a few other things.

In the tools folder, you will find a few random things that I made, some complete, some not, that made playing the game more convient for me.
